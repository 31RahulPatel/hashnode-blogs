## **Revision & Command Mastery: Every Terraform Command You Must Know**

After three solid days of learning and hands-on practice — from building AWS architectures to understanding Terraform State, Providers, and Backends — today was all about **revision**.

Day 4 was my **Terraform Command Deep Dive Day** — a full walkthrough of every command, subcommand, and concept that powers Terraform.

Let’s go through what I revised 👇

---

## ⚙️ **1️⃣ Installation & Setup**

To begin, Terraform must be installed on your system. You can download it directly from:

🔗 [Terraform Downloads Page](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/downloads)

After installation, enable shell autocompletion (saves tons of typing):

```bash
terraform -install-autocomplete
```

---

## 🚀 **2️⃣ Initializing Terraform**

| Command | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `terraform init` | Prepares your working directory for Terraform operations |
| `terraform init -upgrade` | Upgrades modules/providers to their latest versions |
| `terraform get` | Downloads and installs modules used in the configuration |

---

## 🏗️ **3️⃣ Making Infrastructure Changes**

These are your most-used commands during actual deployment work.

| Command | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `terraform plan` | Shows what changes Terraform will make |
| `terraform plan -out=<file>` | Saves a plan to apply later |
| `terraform plan -target <resource>` | Plans changes for a specific resource/module |
| `terraform plan -replace <resource>` | Forces replacement of a specific resource |
| `terraform plan -var '<key>=<value>'` | Overrides variable values temporarily |
| `terraform plan -refresh-only` | Inspects resource drift without changing state |
| `terraform apply` | Creates or updates infrastructure |
| `terraform apply <file>` | Applies a pre-saved plan |
| `terraform apply -target <resource>` | Applies only one target resource |
| `terraform apply -replace <resource>` | Forces replacement of a resource during apply |
| `terraform apply -auto-approve` | Skips confirmation prompt before applying |

---

## 🧾 **4️⃣ Inspecting Output Values**

| Command | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `terraform output` | Displays all output values |
| `terraform output -json` | Outputs all values in JSON |
| `terraform output <name>` | Displays a specific output value |
| `terraform output -raw <name>` | Displays output without quotes |

---

## 📦 **5️⃣ Managing State**

State management is one of Terraform’s most critical parts.

| Command | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `terraform show` | Shows current state in human-readable format |
| `terraform show <file>` | Displays a specific state or plan file |
| `terraform show -json <file>` | Shows a state/plan file in JSON format |
| `terraform state list` | Lists all tracked resources |
| `terraform state show <resource>` | Displays details for one resource |
| `terraform state mv <source> <dest>` | Moves or renames resources in the state |
| `terraform state rm <resource>` | Removes a resource from state |
| `terraform state replace-provider <from> <to>` | Replaces provider for all resources |
| `terraform import <resource> <id>` | Imports existing resources into Terraform |
| `terraform state pull` | Pulls the current remote state |
| `terraform refresh` *(deprecated)* | Updates state to match real infrastructure |

---

## 🧱 **6️⃣ Tainting & Destroying Resources**

| Command | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `terraform taint <resource>` *(deprecated)* | Marks a resource for recreation |
| `terraform untaint <resource>` | Removes taint from a resource |
| `terraform destroy` | Destroys all infrastructure managed by Terraform |
| `terraform destroy -target <resource>` | Destroys a specific resource only |

---

## 🧰 **7️⃣ Formatting & Validation**

| Command | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `terraform validate` | Validates your configuration syntax |
| `terraform fmt` | Formats all `.tf` files in standard style |
| `terraform fmt -check` | Checks formatting without modifying files |

---

## ☁️ **8️⃣ Terraform Cloud / Remote Authentication**

| Command | Description |

## 🌟 **Final Thoughts**

Today’s revision gave me a huge confidence boost 💪  
Mastering Terraform isn’t just about coding — it’s about knowing **when and how to use the right command**.

This session helped me reinforce the flow from **init → plan → apply → manage → destroy**.  
Tomorrow, I’ll explore **Terraform Cloud**, **Workspaces in action**, and **multi-environment management** to simulate a real DevOps scenario.
